# KyaCORE

KyaCORE is the **core** of my "Kya" series of Minecraft plugins. It is not meant to be used on its own, but as an **helper** for using my high-performance plugins.

## Why KyaCORE?

KyaCORE is the essential technical base: it handles common functions and ensures that all dependent plugins work correctly.

## Requirements

- **Minecraft:** 1.19.x - 1.21.x

- **Java:** 17+

3. Restart the server.
